<h3>My Projects</h3>
  <p>You can find all of my projects in the<a href="https://github.com/lorenarms/SNHU_CS_370_Emerging_Trends_in_CS" target="_blank"> projects folder</a>. 
  Some of my favorite projects are the <a href="https://github.com/lorenarms/SNHU_CS_370_Emerging_Trends_in_CS/tree/main/Cartpole" target="_blank"> cartpole problem project</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/lorenarms/SNHU_CS_370_Emerging_Trends_in_CS/tree/main/TreasureHuntGame/TreasureHuntGame" target="_blank"> pirate treasure hunt</a> project.
</p>
<p>For more information about the cartpole problem check out <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-cartepole-problem-competitive-performance-with-particle-swarm-optimization-672f018ede3c" target="_blank"> this article</a> about it. This project involves developing a neural network that learns to balance a "pole" on a "cart" through reinforcement learning. My solution can be found in the link above, and below you can see a screenshot of my results.</p>

<p>The pirate treasure hunt game was a fun project to work on. This involved developing a Q-learning algorithm with a neural network to find the shortest path to the "treasure" before the pirate got there. The project was run in python with Keras, and the starting and ending grids can be seen below. For more information about what this problem entails check out<a href="https://gotensor.com/2019/10/02/q-learning-an-introduction-through-a-simple-table-based-implementation-with-learning-rate-discount-factor-and-exploration/" target="_blank"> this article</a> about it. My solution can be found in the link above.</p>

<p>
In order to run the projects above (and any others here in the repo) you will need Python installed on your machine, as well as Jupyter Notebooks. There are a variety of other libraries that you'll want to get as well (such as matplotlib, Keras, Tensorflow, numpy, and others), but once you have JN installed and attempt to run a project, you will be error-ed out with a message of which library you need. Just download and install the appropriate files using pip and you should be good to go!
